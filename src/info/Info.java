The third dragon determines the map and all dragon spawns afterwards will be of the same type until one team gets a soul point (by killing four dragons). The type of dragon soul is determined by the dominant type of dragons slain in the four dragons that a team kills, which is the type of the third dragon spawned. </p> </html>";
