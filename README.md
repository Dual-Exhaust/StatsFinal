## Usage

### Main Menu
The main menu is where the program opens to. At the top of the panel there are buttons that will take you to different pages where you can view the related findings. General Information shows what the project was about and what sources were used while investigating the topic. Each of the chapter buttons will take you to a menu for that respective chapter, outlining what content we utilized in our research from it. Findings will display a short paper that was written to summarize what was found while researching for this project. It is not all inclusive, but touches on what we found to be the most important parts of our findings. For more in depth explanations, please see each individual chapter. Exit will simply close the program.

### Chapters
Each chapter panel contains three items in it. On the left there is a list where you can select which section of the chapter to view. In the middle there is a graphic that will contain information pertaining to that section. The right most item will be a summary or explanation in text saying what was done. Some sections' graphics will be all inclusive and contain the summaries in them. At the bottom there is a button labelled main menu that will just take you back to the main menu.
